# Analysis-of-Wildlife-Strikes-on-Civil-Aviation
Wildlife strikes are the consequence of various factors. These factors include migration of species, weather, time-of-day, phase of flight and the region of the flightâ€™s route. However, some of the questions remain to be addressed with solid observational data.

## Description
This project focuses on the aforementioned factors and try to ascertain levels of contribution for each factor. This project aim is to provide indepth analysis of dataset includes visualization through various types of graphs which have been used to demonstrate a concise overview of the bird strike problem in commercial aviation and also the factors contributing to the occurrence and the potential consequences in terms of effect on the flight and damage. 
## Datasets
There are two datasets used in this analysis. Wildlife strikes data is downloaded from [FAA Wildlife Strike Database](https://wildlife.faa.gov/home). It Contains data from 1990 to 2021, consisting of 260,000 records, and 100 fields covering all states in US. 

The other dataset used is Aviation accidents dataset, has been collected from [NTSB aviation accident database](https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/data/Pages/Data_Stats.aspx) contains information from 1990 to 2021. It consists of about 88000 records covering 49 different states of the US from the years 1990 to 2021. Both datasets are integrated using Outer Join. 
## Data Methods
### Data Cleaning
- Filtering out the bad data
-  checking for the null or missing values in the data.
### Data Preprocessing
- outlier analysis of the data.
- Checking for the outliers and replacing with the appropriate data measures upon the analysis.
### Data Transformation
- Reformatting the data, changing the structure, or values of data by making it more organized for the visualizations.
- checking the correlation between the fields, checking for any patterns or relations between the fields in the data.
## Dataset Analysis
- Analysis of the Birds - species types, bird migration and traits.
- Wildlife species involved in strikes.
- Analysis of Bird strikes by State, region and altitude.
- Analysis of Bird strikes by weather conditions.
- Analysis of the Airports and aircraft damages.
- Phase of Flight and Time of Day has more impact on the strikes.
- Analysis of economic losses due to wildlife strikes.
- Impact on Human fatalities and injuries due to strikes.
